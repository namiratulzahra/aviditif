The blue bars are the male population for each five-year age bracket, while the pink bars are the female population; the bars are partially transparent so that you can see how they overlap, unlike the traditional side-by-side<sup><a href="#2">[2]</a></sup> display which makes it difficult to compare the relative distribution of the sexes.</p>

    <h4>DESCRIPTION</h4><br>
    <p>A population pyramid, also called an age pyramid or age picture diagram, is a graphical illustration that shows the distribution of various age groups in a population (typically that of a country or region of the world), which forms the shape of a pyramid when the population is growing. It is also used in ecology to determine the overall age distribution of a population; an indication of the reproductive capabilities and likelihood of the continuation of a species.</p>

    <p>It usually consists of two back-to-back histograms, with the population plotted on the X-axis and age on the Y-axis, one showing the number of males and one showing females in a particular population in five-year age groups (also called cohorts). Males are conventionally shown on the left and females on the right, and they may be measured by raw number or as a percentage of the total population.</p>
